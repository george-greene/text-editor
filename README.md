# text-editor
Various implementations of a personal text editor.

The goal is to develop a program that I can use as a daily driver.

I also want to explore multiple languages and frameworks for building it.

This repo is organized by implementation. So for example, folders "electron", "tauri", and "\*\_ncurses" contain their respective implementations.
